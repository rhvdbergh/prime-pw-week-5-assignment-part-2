    <li>Does capitalization matter when using preset colors in CSS? (e.g., lightgray vs. lightGray vs. LightGray) They all seem to work - but will there be compatibility issues on other browsers?</li>
    <li>background-image fills the screen with both html and body as selectors in CSS. Which one would be the better choice?</li>
